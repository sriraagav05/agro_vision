🌱 AgroVision – AI-Powered Smart Agriculture Platform

AgroVision is an AI-driven web application designed to help farmers and agricultural stakeholders make early, data-driven decisions by combining crop disease detection, crop lifecycle simulation, and financial risk analysis into a single intelligent system.

Instead of reacting after crop damage occurs, AgroVision focuses on predicting risks early and supporting better planning.

🚜 Problem Statement

Modern agriculture faces critical challenges:

    -Late detection of crop diseases
    
    -Limited access to expert agricultural guidance
    
    -Financial uncertainty before investing in crops
    
    -Fragmented tools for analysis and decision-making
    
    -AgroVision addresses these challenges by integrating AI, computer vision, and analytics into one platform.
